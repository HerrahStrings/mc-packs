**Tinkerer's Quilt**  (TQuilt) is a set of minecraft modpacks by Kapesi, Clawby, Herrah and Le'mer.     
Their design is centered on three pillars: **Vanilla Compatibility**, **Accessibility/UX**, and **Expression**

All packs run on Minecraft 1.18.2 and the **Quilt** mod loader

---

The three editions are as follows
- **Tinkerer's Quilt ("Base")** is the heart of all this. It's **Vanilla-World-Compatible**, with **no new items, blocks, or worldgen**. 
  - Base is designed to **teach you vanilla** through **fully in-game** quests and item info - you'll never need to open the wiki.
  - Base is built with a curated set of Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to ease the pains of vanilla.
  - Base is designed to be **easier than vanilla** with expressive origins, simplified enchanting/repair, and helpful quest rewards.

**Base** is designed to allow more experienced players to add extra mods.     
**Plus** and **Modded** is simply us doing exactly that - to our own tastes!    
The rest of this document focuses on Base, so here's a quick breakdown:

- **Plus** is a Vanilla+ extension of base, including all of its quests.
  - Plus adds mods that expand on the **Godseeking** fields from base:
    - **Homesteading** - more farming and ranching, _way_ more cooking, more building blocks, and more decorations.
    - **Exploration** - many more traversal options, new nether/end, new biomes, new structures, and a seasonal world.
    - **Combat** - adding spears, chef's knives, and... compact mechanically propelled halfdoors? Plus new dungeons.
- **Modded** a simple extension of plus, adding personal favourite major mods
  - Each mod is larger, with a complex progression equivalent to Base's **The Basics** tree, and then some.
  - **Botania** - Collect mana, power magic flowers, and study the elves in this beautifully simple magi-tech mod.
  - **Create** - Build steampunkish masses of driveshafts, pistons, and conveyor belts in this larger-than-life old-tech mod.
  - **Tinker's Construct** - While still unstable on Quilt, TCon3 is our favourite rework of the tool/weapon system  - ever.



      - Provide returning players information on new features and content the game has included since they might last have played.
  
      - Provide shortcuts to players to help them progress and to get into "Special Interest" systems they might otherwise avoid, and reward them for investing their time into each.

# Pack Features

## Questing System
***"It's like FTB Academy for Vanilla!"*** - Us, just now

TQuilt's quests help guide old and new players through the core progression of minecraft, and explore all the way out the far reaches of what it has to offer.

### The Basics
      
<img width="425" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174097642-a5949541-b8e6-419b-bbfe-b3e4ecf90be8.png"><img width="325" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174098114-c5630f29-efaa-4473-9eb4-e53c4325f002.png">

Core game progression - get unfamiliar players on track, keep goals visible, and engage directly through tasks and rewards.

### Godseeking
Explore all parts of the game and many special interests - categorised by **Homesteading**, **Self-Defense**, and **Exploration**.   
Do you want to...
 - ‚öîÔ∏è Know every weapon and kill every enemy? 
 - üè† Make bases in many environments? 
 - üåæ farm anything and everything, including crops? 
 - üó∫Ô∏è Explore the world and what's found there? 
 - üõ†Ô∏è Craft the best gear in your own workshop? 
 - üõ£Ô∏è Build transit infrastructure and achieve ludicrous speed? 
 - ‚öôÔ∏è Make terrifyingly complex machines and mechanisms? 

It's all there! Including things even we didn't about before making this pack!     
These quests can help players discover these parts of the game, and have rewards to provide helpful shortcuts.     
Complete all quests of a special interest to complete its **Patron Quest** for very special rewards and incredible banners.   
But beware - some quests are very difficult!

Quests are also home to information about the pack itself, as a helpful reference guide.   
The **Introduction** quests cover's the pack's main features, while the **Discrepancies** quests helps players know what isn't vanilla.

## Homebrew Changes

Yeah yeah, we get it - packs that just throw mods together are no fun. Here's what we pulled together besides our curation skills:

 - Three mods: 
   - [Portable Crafting Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting-standalone) - Press V or click a tab to use the crafting table in your inventory. 
   - [Totem Anywhere Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/totem-anywhere-standalone) - Death penalty is low in this mod, so - totem convenience - uses totems from inventory.  
   - [Crunchy Crunchy Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements) - Hides and removes advancements - quests and [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) covers all you need.
 - Six data packs: (use [this](https://download-directory.github.io) for downloads)
   - [Tinkerer's Statures](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_statures) (Origins) - allows choosing player height on spawn.
   - [Tinkerer's Vegetarian](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vegetarian) - adds "Vegetarian" (no killing passive mobs) recipes for potions, leather, books, and more.
   - [Tinkerer's Repair](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_repair) - adds repairing at a smithing table with no XP cost, and reverting prior work using netherite scrap.
     - Flattens the power creep of mending, encouraging players to keep "Sentimental" tools as much as they like.
   - [Tinkerer's Copper Beacons](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_copper_beacons) - Allows beacons to be made of unexposed copper blocks. A use for Copper and Wax!
   - [Tinkerer's Human't](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_humant) (Origins) - removes mention of "human" and "nitwit" from origins/+classes descriptions.
   - Tinkerer's [Vampire](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vampire)/[Imp](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_imp)/[Dryad](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_dryad) (Origins) - homebrew mods of others' origins. Some small, some not - more planned.
 - Mod Configuration:
   - 194 Quests over 6 categories in Base (FTB Quests)
     - Just as many flavour text subtitles - queer humour, quick observations, and references to things we don't remember.
     - An unholy amount of quest descriptions, explaining how to achieve the task, what the required items do, etc.
     - Meticulously symmetrical and categorized quest positioning. No really. Hours and hours of it.
   - An uncomfortable amount of configuring mods to not have their functionality overlap with other mods. Full days of it.
   - Thinking a little too hard about choosing keybinds that are actually easy to remember (I wish modifier keys were vanilla). 
 - Actually, honestly, a lot of just _thinking_, frankly. An intense amount. Mod suitability, configs, overlaps, bugs - we're _tired_.
   - This is still an endorsement, we swear.
   - There was a lot of notepad documents and messy organisation systems to get this done. We wrote a whole skyrim-style "modding guide" in early 2021 for what would eventually become this pack. Terrifying stuff.
   - Also reporting a lot of bugs and incompatibilities to mod developers. And quilt developers.
     - That's an endorsement too.
     - Thanks everyone.

## Features from Mods

All minecraft modding projects are built on over a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).   
The rest of the cool stuff is just us bringing together the work of great modders in the community.    
Shoutouts are well-deserved here, so we're dropping links for all these major features. 

### Player Expression

<img width="700" height="262" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png">
