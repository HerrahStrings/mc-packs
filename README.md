**Tinkerer's Quilt**  (TQuilt) is a set of minecraft modpacks by Kapesi, Clawby, Herrah and Le'mer.     
Their design is centered on three pillars: **Vanilla Compatibility**, **Accessibility/UX**, and **Expression**

All packs run on Minecraft 1.18.2 and the **Quilt** mod loader

---

The three editions are as follows
- [Released] **Tinkerer's Quilt ("Base")** is the heart of all this. It's **Vanilla-World-Compatible**, with **no new items, blocks, or worldgen**. 
  - Designed to **teach you vanilla** through **fully in-game** quests and item info - you'll never need to open the wiki.
  - Built with a curated set of Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to ease the pains of vanilla.
  - **Easier than vanilla** with expressive origins, simplified enchanting/repair, and helpful quest rewards.

**Base** is designed to allow more experienced players to add extra mods.     
**Plus** and **Modded** is simply us doing exactly that - to our own tastes!    
The rest of this document focuses on Base, so here's a quick breakdown:

- [WIP] **Plus** is a Vanilla+ extension of base, including all of its quests.
  - Plus adds mods that expand on the **Godseeking** fields from base:
    - **Homesteading** - More farming/ranching, _way_ more cooking, more building blocks, and more decorations.
    - **Exploration** - More traversal options, new nether/end, new biomes, new structures, and a seasonal world.
    - **Combat** - Spears, chef's knives, and... compact mechanically propelled halfdoors? Plus new dungeons.
- [WIP] **Modded** a simple extension of plus, adding personal favourite major mods
  - Each mod is larger, with a complex progression equivalent to Base's **The Basics** tree, and then some.
  - **Botania** - Collect mana, power magic flowers, and study the elves in this beautifully simple magi-tech mod.
  - **Create** - Build steampunk masses of driveshafts, pistons, and conveyors in this larger-than-life old-tech mod.
  - **Tinker's Construct** - Though unstable on Quilt, TCon3 is our favourite tool/weapon system rework - ever.

# Pack Features

## Questing System
***"It's like FTB Academy for Vanilla!"*** - Us, just now

TQuilt's quests help guide old and new players through the core progression of minecraft, and explore all the way out the far reaches of what it has to offer.

### The Basics
      
<img width="425" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174097642-a5949541-b8e6-419b-bbfe-b3e4ecf90be8.png"><img width="325" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174098114-c5630f29-efaa-4473-9eb4-e53c4325f002.png">

Core game progression - get unfamiliar players on track, keep goals visible, and engage directly through tasks and rewards.

### Godseeking
Explore all parts of the game and many special interests - categorised by **Homesteading**, **Self-Defense**, and **Exploration**.   
Do you want to...
 - ‚öîÔ∏è Know every weapon and kill every enemy? 
 - üè† Make bases in many environments? 
 - üåæ farm anything and everything, including crops? 
 - üó∫Ô∏è Explore the world and what's found there? 
 - üõ†Ô∏è Craft the best gear in your own workshop? 
 - üõ£Ô∏è Build transit infrastructure and achieve ludicrous speed? 
 - ‚öôÔ∏è Make terrifyingly complex machines and mechanisms? 

It's all there! Including things even we didn't know about before making this pack!     
These quests can help players discover these parts of the game, and have rewards to provide helpful shortcuts.     
Complete all quests of a special interest to complete its **Patron Quest** for very special rewards and incredible banners.        
But beware - some quests are very difficult!

Quests are also home to information about the pack itself, as a helpful reference guide.   
**Introduction** quests cover's the pack's main features, while **Discrepancies** quests helps players know what isn't vanilla.

## Homebrew Changes

Yeah yeah, we get it - packs that just throw mods together are no fun. Here's what we pulled together besides our curation skills:

 - Four mods: 
   - [Portable Crafting Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting-standalone) - Press V or click a tab to use the crafting table in your inventory. 
   - [Totem Anywhere Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/totem-anywhere-standalone) - Totem of undying convenience - uses totems from inventory.  
   - [Crunchy Crunchy Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements) - Hides and removes advancements - quests and [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) covers all you need.
   - [Tinkerer's Smithing](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing) - Repair for no XP cost, lower repair cost with scrap, and upgrade tool materials.
     - Flattens mending power creep, encouraging players to keep "Sentimental" tools as much as they like.
     - Tool material upgrades cost the exact same as a fresh tool - but keep the enchantments.
     - Quicker tools with less waste - upgrade wood to stone to iron from the 2x2 crafting grid.
  - Six data packs: (use [this](https://download-directory.github.io) for downloads)
   - [Tinkerer's Statures](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_statures) (Origins) - allows choosing player height on spawn.
   - [Tinkerer's Vegetarian](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vegetarian) (NBT) - recipes for potions, leather, books, and more, without killing passive mobs.
   - [Tinkerer's Copper Beacons](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_copper_beacons) - Allows beacons made of unexposed copper blocks. A use for Copper and Wax!
   - [Tinkerer's Human't](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_humant) (Origins) - Removes mention of "human" and "nitwit" from origins/+classes descriptions.
   - Tinkerer's [Vampire](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vampire)/[Imp](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_imp)/[Dryad](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_dryad) (Origins) - Mods of others' origins. Some small, some not - more planned.
 - Mod Configuration:
   - 194 Quests over 6 categories in Base (FTB Quests)
     - Just as many flavour text subtitles - queer humour, observations, and a weird mix of references.
     - An unholy amount of quest descriptions - how to achieve the task, what the required items do, etc.
     - Meticulously symmetrical and categorized quest positioning. No really. Hours and hours of it.
   - An uncomfortable amount of configuring mods avoid functionality overlap with other mods. Full days of it.
   - Thinking too hard about choosing keybinds that are easy to remember (We wish modifier keys were vanilla). 
 - Actually, a lot of just _thinking_. An intense amount. Mod suitability, configs, overlaps, bugs - we're _tired_.
   - This is still an endorsement, we swear.
   - There was a lot of notepad documents and messy organisation systems to get this done. We wrote a whole skyrim-style "modding guide" in early 2021 for what would eventually become this pack. Terrifying stuff.
   - Also reporting a lot of bugs and incompatibilities to mod developers. And quilt developers.
     - That's an endorsement too.
     - Thanks everyone.

## Features from Mods

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).   
The rest of the cool stuff is just us bringing together the work of great modders in the community.    
Shoutouts are well-deserved here, so we're dropping links for all these major features. 

### Player Expression

Letting players express themselves with player customisation, builds, and even things like farming, cooking, and brewing, is a core tenet of the pack.
    
 - [Ears](https://ears.unascribed.com/) - Improved skins with support for tails, horns, ears, claws, wings and more species/gender things!
 - [Fabric Tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrictailor) - Swap your skin in-game. Perfect for plural systems.
 - [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) - Choose a player _Origin_, granting abilities, limitations, and maybe species euphoria (we don't know you)
   - Uses our own curated set of custom and vanilla origins, with a separate selector for player height ("Stature")     

     <img width="700" height="262" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png">

 - [What The Hell Is That?](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) - Hold alt to see information on the block or mob you're looking at.     
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174112665-b8b534e2-5b8d-450e-91dd-260869086719.png)
