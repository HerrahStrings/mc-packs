**Tinkerer's Quilt** is a minecraft modpack by Kapesi, Clawby, Herrah and Le'mer.     
It runs on minecraft version 1.18.2 and the **Quilt** mod loader


The design of the pack is focused around **three pillars**:

------

**Vanilla Compatibility**
 - **No new items, no new blocks, and no changes to worldgen.** Bring in old saves and possibly even keep Tinkerer's Quilt saves for vanilla use! (no guarantees)

**Usability, Accessbility, Discoverability**
  - More of the game accessible to more players in more pleasant ways.
    - **QoL changes** to reduce minor annoyances, **balance changes** to avoid pain points and flatten power creep through buffs, and **minor mechanic changes** to bring more depth and draw to easily-ignored systems.
      - Changes to avoid in-game pain points for certain players - Including changes for playing with "Vegetarianism" (no harming passive mobs), and buffs and improvements to pets and mounts.
    - **In-game sources of direction and information**, with quests covering both vanilla progression and features, along with what's changed in the pack. And of course, the legendary in-game crafting wiki itself - REI.

      - Provide returning players information on new features and content the game has included since they might last have played.
  
      - Provide shortcuts to players to help them progress and to get into "Special Interest" systems they might otherwise avoid, and reward them for investing their time into each.

**Individual Expression**
 - Easily swappable character appearances that go further in-depth than the vanilla game - all explained in the quest book. Show your colours with **nonhuman skin features, varied heights, and new flavours of gameplay**.

   - Designed with systems in mind, reworking where possible to make these "expressives" swappable on the fly.

The name is based around the creators, not the content - sorry!

# Installation

 - Install [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) and [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) (most windows users will want `Windows-x64-JRE-17-.msi`)

   - `winget install polymc` and `winget install --id EclipseAdoptium.TemurinJRE.17` works too!

 - Download [Tinkerer's Quilt.zip](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/website/Installs/Tinkerer's%201.18.2.zip)

 - Drag and drop onto an open PolyMC window!
